# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.  

The JavaScript code for this module is found in the static folder and the js folder as *app.js*  

Help with this assignment came from various YouTube videos describing the use of arrow notation for functions and d3 examples. I also used StackOverflow and the D3 documentation for additional examples and help with things like the "options" portion of the dropdown menu and the formatting for the BubbleChart. I also had to look up the method for "object.entries" and read up on how that works for creating the key-value pair for the metadata that was displayed on the dashboard.  

After working on this assignment, I am realizing that there are a lot of methods that are built into the different libraries, but I am not familiar with many of them yet. I found myself looking up a lot more supporting documents to complete this assignment than I have needed to during the previous python-focused assignments. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot, but I would still like to dive deeper to better understand the logic and order of execution for JavaScript and HTML based code.
